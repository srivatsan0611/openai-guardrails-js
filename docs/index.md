# Guardrails

**Guardrails** is a safety framework for LLM applications that automatically validates inputs and outputs using configurable checks. Use the [Guardrails Wizard](https://guardrails.openai.com/) to create configurations, then drop in our client classes for automatic validation.

## Why Guardrails

- **Drop-in replacement** for OpenAI clients with automatic validation
- **No-code configuration** via the Guardrails Wizard
- **Pipeline-based** validation across input, output, and pre-flight stages
- **Production ready** for real-world LLM applications

## How It Works

1. **Configure**: Use the Wizard or define pipeline configurations
2. **Replace**: Use `GuardrailsOpenAI` instead of `OpenAI`
3. **Validate**: Guardrails run automatically on every API call
4. **Handle**: Access results via `response.guardrail_results`

## Built-in Guardrails

- **Content Safety**: Moderation, jailbreak detection
- **Data Protection**: PII detection, URL filtering  
- **Content Quality**: Hallucination detection, off topic prompts

## Quickstart

```typescript
import { GuardrailsOpenAI } from '@openai/guardrails';

async function main() {
  const client = await GuardrailsOpenAI.create({
    version: 1,
    output: {
      version: 1,
      guardrails: [
        { name: 'Moderation', config: { categories: ['hate', 'violence'] } }
      ]
    }
  });

  const response = await client.responses.create({
    model: 'gpt-5',
    input: 'Hello'
  });

  console.log(response.output_text);
}

main();
```
